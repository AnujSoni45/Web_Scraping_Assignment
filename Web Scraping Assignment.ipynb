    "Web scraping can be achieved using various methods and tools, depending on the complexity of the task and the \n",
    "structure of the websites you're targeting. Here are some common methods used for web scraping:\n",
    "\n",
    "Manual Copy-Pasting: This is the simplest form of web scraping, where you manually copy and paste the required \n",
    "information from web pages into a local file or spreadsheet. While this approach works for small-scale tasks, \n",
    "it's not efficient for large-scale data collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular Expressions (Regex): Regular expressions are patterns used to match and extract specific strings from \n",
    "text. They can be useful for extracting simple data from web pages that have consistent patterns, such as phone \n",
    "numbers or email addresses. However, using regex for more complex tasks can become unwieldy and error-prone.\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML Parsing Libraries: These libraries provide tools to parse the HTML structure of web pages and extract\n",
    "information from specific elements. Popular libraries include BeautifulSoup (Python), Nokogiri (Ruby), and jsoup \n",
    "(Java). These libraries make it easier to navigate the DOM (Document Object Model) and extract data based on tags, \n",
    "asses, or IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web Scraping Frameworks: These frameworks offer more advanced features for web scraping, often including user \n",
    "agent rotation, handling cookies, and managing sessions. Scrapy (Python) is a popular framework that provides a \n",
    "structured way to build complex scraping projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Headless Browsers: A headless browser is a browser that can be used programmatically to navigate web pages just \n",
    "like a regular browser, but without a graphical user interface. "
